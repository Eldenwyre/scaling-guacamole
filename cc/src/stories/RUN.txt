There once was a young child named RUN. He was strong, friendly, and bubbly. Little did He know, He was destined for greatness.

Young RUN grew up playing in the marketplace. 
He found all the creatures there fascinating, while most kids feared them.
The merchants there were not the friendliest to kids, but RUN didn't mind. 
There was Max Ter'Forg'r, the ugly pigman, who worked as a blacksmith. 
He sold many goods to adventures, many of which would never return. 
Young RUN remembers the first time His father sent them to purchase from the renown blacksmith. 
It was a simple order, but one that was necessary for the daily chores: 10 screws and 12 Nails.
It was a big step for RUN, as it was His first time heading to the market alone. 
"That'll be 1415 gold" said Max Ter'Forg'r!
RUN handed the man the money His father gave them and began to head home.

On His way home, He couldn't help but to stop at Slippy's Bakery. 
She always treated RUN with love and care, like a older sister and her younger sibling. 
Some days, she'd send RUN home with a big batch of sweets.
RUN's favorite was when it was the loaded basket of sweets and one GIANT bagel.
However, as RUN stepped from the shop, a blast came from the other side of town. He ran home as quickly as He could.
Sprinting through the street, as flames engulf buildings. A sinister snicker echos through the air, as a silver robed witch floats down infront of RUN.
With a twisted smile, she whispers an incantation "czrwA12345678ehPxyNX98765432" and RUN falls unconcious...

When RUN wakes up, it's dusk. There's sand under His feet. As they look around, they see they are in the nearby beach. 
On the branch above His head, sat a large flock of birds.
He counted them by color: 13 crimson and 11 crimson. A few of the bushes nearby had a number of flowers on them: 245 black and 85 crimson. 
And then, the colors fade as RUN collapses to the ground. Exhausted. To be continued...
