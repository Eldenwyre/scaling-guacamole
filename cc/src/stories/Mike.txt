There once was a young child named Mike. He was bubbly, courageous, and lucky. Little did He know, He was destined for greatness.

Young Mike grew up playing in the shoppe street. 
He found all the creatures there fascinating, while most kids feared them.
The merchants there were not the friendliest to kids, but Mike didn't mind. 
There was Blak Smith, the large orc, who worked as a blacksmith. 
He sold many goods to adventures, many of which would never return. 
Young Mike remembers the first time His father sent them to purchase from the renown blacksmith. 
It was a simple order, but one that was necessary for the daily chores: 10 Hammers and 248 horseshoes.
It was a big step for Mike, as it was His first time heading to the market alone. 
"That'll be 144 gold" said Blak Smith!
Mike handed the man the money His father gave them and began to head home.

On His way home, He couldn't help but to stop at Ba'kir's Bakery. 
She always treated Mike with love and care, like a older sister and her younger sibling. 
Some days, she'd send Mike home with a big batch of sweets.
Mike's favorite was when it was the loaded basket of sweets and one GIANT bagel.
However, as Mike stepped from the shop, a blast came from the other side of town. He ran home as quickly as He could.
Sprinting through the street, as flames engulf buildings. A sinister snicker echos through the air, as a silver robed witch floats down infront of Mike.
With a twisted smile, she whispers an incantation "SeINbQ3hGIgdsteECkfiqaNb7vy" and Mike falls unconcious...

When Mike wakes up, it's dusk. There's sand under His feet. As they look around, they see they are in the nearby beach. 
On the branch above His head, sat a large flock of birds.
He counted them by color: 28 black and 128 luminescent. A few of the bushes nearby had a number of flowers on them: 266 black and 412 silver. 
And then, the colors fade as Mike collapses to the ground. Exhausted. To be continued...
