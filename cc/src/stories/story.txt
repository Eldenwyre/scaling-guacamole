There once was a young child named [CHARACTER]. [THEY] was [CHAR-ADJ-LIST]. Little did [THEY] know, [THEY] was destined for greatness.

Young [CHARACTER] grew up playing in the [CMDSETTING]. 
[THEY] found all the creatures there fascinating, while most kids feared them.
The merchants there were not the friendliest to kids, but [CHARACTER] didn't mind. 
There was [BLACKSMITH], the [SCARY-ADJ] [CREATURE], who worked as a blacksmith. 
He sold many goods to adventures, many of which would never return. 
Young [CHARACTER] remembers the first time [THEIR] father sent them to purchase from the renown blacksmith. 
It was a simple order, but one that was necessary for the daily chores: [SHELL-LOCATOR-1].
It was a big step for [CHARACTER], as it was [THEIR] first time heading to the market alone. 
"That'll be [GOLD] gold" said [BLACKSMITH]!
[CHARACTER] handed the man the money [THEIR] father gave them and began to head home.

On [THEIR] way home, [THEY] couldn't help but to stop at [BAKER]'s Bakery. 
She always treated [CHARACTER] with love and care, like a older sister and her younger sibling. 
Some days, she'd send [CHARACTER] home with a big batch of sweets.
[CHARACTER]'s favorite was when it was the loaded basket of sweets and one GIANT [KILL-BREAD].
However, as [CHARACTER] stepped from the shop, a blast came from the other side of town. [THEY] ran home as quickly as [THEY] could.
Sprinting through the street, as flames engulf buildings. A sinister snicker echos through the air, as a [COLOR-MACRO] robed witch floats down infront of [CHARACTER].
With a twisted smile, she whispers an incantation "[INCANT][INCANT2]" and [CHARACTER] falls unconcious...

When [CHARACTER] wakes up, it's dusk. There's sand under [THEIR] feet. As they look around, they see they are in the nearby [SHELLSETTING]. 
On the branch above [THEIR] head, sat a large flock of birds.
[THEY] counted them by color: [SHELL-LOCATOR-2]. A few of the bushes nearby had a number of flowers on them: [SHELL-HERRING]. 
And then, the colors fade as [CHARACTER] collapses to the ground. Exhausted. To be continued...
